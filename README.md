facial keypoint detection from kaggle. code from http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/

the first model is a simple model. 

the second model use convolutional neural nets.It is much more computationally costly. In my GTX960 GPU, it runs for 24 mins.

the third model is a example of Data augmentation, flipping the images horizontically to get better performance.
